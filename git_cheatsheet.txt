This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. (You might consider bookmarking this handy page.) 
Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:

##Commands related to a remote repository:

git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git

git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)

##Commands related to workflow:

git add .

git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"

##Commands related to checking status or log history

git status

git log

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

##For example,

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination).

Testing your SSH connection
After you've set up your SSH key and added it to your account on GitHub.com, you can test your connection.


Linux
Before testing your SSH connection, you should have:

Checked for existing SSH keys
Generated a new SSH key
Added a new SSH key to your GitHub account
When you test your connection, you'll need to authenticate this action using your password, which is the SSH key passphrase you created earlier. For more information on working with SSH key passphrases, see "Working with SSH key passphrases".

Open Terminal.

Enter the following:

$ ssh -T git@github.com
# Attempts to ssh to GitHub
You may see a warning like this:

> The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
> RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
Verify that the fingerprint in the message you see matches GitHub's public key fingerprint. If it does, then type yes:

> Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
> provide shell access.
You may see this error message:

...
Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.
debug1: No more authentication methods to try.
Permission denied (publickey).
This is a known problem with certain Linux distributions. For more information, see "Error: Agent admitted failure to sign".

Note: The remote command should exit with code 1.

Verify that the resulting message contains your username. If you receive a "permission denied" message, see "Error: Permission denied (publickey)".
